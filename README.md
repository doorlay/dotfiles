## Dotfiles 
Run the following to symlink all your local dotfiles to this repo and set your default shell to bash:
```
git clone https://github.com/doorlay/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

#### Notes
- Make desired updates to this repo, not your local dotfiles
- `install.sh` is idempotent
